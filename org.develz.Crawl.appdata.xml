        <p>
          We are pleased to announce the release of Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup
          0.27 “The Cursed Flame”!
        </p>
        <p>
          DCSS 0.27 features a new Djinni species that cast spells using HP, can
          only learn new spells at random as they level up, and only use the
          spellcasting skill to train magic. We’ve redesigned Ashenzari, who now
          offers curses for your gear to gain piety and skill levels, at the
          cost of destroying the item when the curse is removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A batch of new spells have been added, including Manifold Assault,
          which attacks multiple foes at once with your melee, Storm Form, which
          transforms you into a tempest with electrified, cleaving melee and the
          ability to hurl yourself as lightning at foes, and Animate Armour,
          which draws out the spirit of your armor to fight by your side. Polar
          Vortex is a more damaging, ice-themed replacement for Tornado.
          Maxwell’s Capacitive Coupling is a level 8 air-themed replacement for
          Absolute Zero that vaporizes a nearby monster after a delay. Chain
          Lightning has been reworked into a more powerful level 9 spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spell books have many new types and generate more often, but contain
          fewer spells. We’ve re-balanced branch monster sets and end maps, as
          well as made new end maps for Lair, Shoals, and Snake. As always,
          there are dozens of new deadly vaults, and many more changes small and
          large alike!
        </p>

          <li>Alt-F4 no longer causes freezing in Tiles on Windows systems.</li>
          <li>Resizing the local Tiles window during prompts no longer causes crashes.</li>
          <li>SDL 2 contrib updated to 2.0.7, which fixes compilation under Msys2.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Dith shadow mimics of launcher attacks were giving you all free
          enchantment and ego damage. That's simply unfair to those poor
          dungeon monsters, so we had to fix it! The numlock key causing
          repeating movement was reported by users far and wide, so many thanks
          to advil for tracking down and fixing that rather difficult bug.
          Hopefully you enjoy the new splash art by South Korean artist froggy,
          whose inspirational depiction of Boris and Natasha is a personal
          favorite.
