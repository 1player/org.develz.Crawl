        <description>
          <p>
            Major bug fixes and updates:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Support for distributing player ghosts files with releases. Now local games will have a starting set of ghosts available for ghost vaults.</li>
            <li>New tiles for Azrael, shock serpents, dream sheep, mana vipers, and the Robe of Vines.</li>
            <li>An additional set of Gnoll player doll tiles (male and female).</li>
            <li>Fix WebTiles menus for older versions of Firefox.</li>
            <li>81 bug fixes, adjustments, and cleanups in total.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              The biggest game-play change in this release is the incorporation
              of ghost data taken from 0.22 games played on the CAO and CBRO
              servers for use in offline games. 0.22 introduced “permastore”
              bones files so that ghost vaults always have an available ghost
              definition to draw from. If a level has no recently made ghost in
              the normal bones file, the permastore file provides more long-term
              data that can be repeatedly drawn upon. The problem was that
              offline games previously had no initial ghost data, forcing ghost
              vaults to fall back on making clone ghosts of the player. Thanks
              to work by advil, crawl can look for pre-existing permastore bones
              files we ship in the game data, copying these over to use as a
              player’s starting permastore. advil has curated this ghost data to
              remove excessive numbers of ghosts from the most popular combos
              and to filter out any offensive usernames. In the future, we’ll be
              able to make this release ghost data using more servers and will
              be improving the way the ghost data is handled and stored in
              general. If you have previously installed 0.22.0, we recommend
              that you remove any files named `*.store.*` from the bones
              subdirectory of your saves folder, in order to get the full effect
              of this change.
          </p>
          <p>
            As usual, there are scores of smaller bug fixes, vault tweaks,
            description updates, and the like, so be sure to upgrade! In the
            bullet list above, I’ve linked a few new tiles we received for trunk
            that I’ve also added to 0.22.1. Also, a certain worm tells me that
            we may have a couple new splash screens coming our way. One will
            depict the exploits of a Deep Dwarf Artificer and the other the
            antics of uniques like Asterion and Louise (PlogChamp)! No ETA on
            these new splash images, but look for them to arrive in trunk when
            they’re ready.
          </p>
          <p>Happy Crawling!</p>

    <release version="0.21.1" date="2018-02-03">
      <description>
        <p>Major bugfixes and updates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dith shadow mimic of launcher attacks no longer copies the enchant and ego of the launcher.</li>
          <li>Monsters lose constriction by Borgnjor's Vile Clutch when they are moved by any means.</li>
          <li>Formicids can now manually cancel Dig status, allowing them to use Wu Jian's Wall Jump ability after digging.</li>
          <li>Wu Jian's Wall Jump ability now works under silence.</li>
          <li>New splash screen art by froggy.</li>
          <li>Numlock on Windows systems no longer causes unpredictable repeating movement.</li>
          <li>Alt-F4 no longer causes freezing in Tiles on Windows systems.</li>
          <li>Resizing the local Tiles window during prompts no longer causes crashes.</li>
          <li>SDL 2 contrib updated to 2.0.7, which fixes compilation under Msys2.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Dith shadow mimics of launcher attacks were giving you all free
          enchantment and ego damage. That's simply unfair to those poor
          dungeon monsters, so we had to fix it! The numlock key causing
          repeating movement was reported by users far and wide, so many thanks
          to advil for tracking down and fixing that rather difficult bug.
          Hopefully you enjoy the new splash art by South Korean artist froggy,
          whose inspirational depiction of Boris and Natasha is a personal
          favorite.
